This is just an overview of the LearnOpenGL topics regarding vectors, matrices, and how we apply them to graphics programming. 

**Vectors**

Vectors are simply directions and nothing more. A vector has a direction and a magnitude (AKA length). You can think of vectors like a point on a map. Vectors have can work with 2 to 4 dimensions. If a vector has 2 dimensions it represents a direction on an (X,Y) plane and in a 3
