This is just an overview of the LearnOpenGL topics regarding vectors, matrices, and how we apply them to graphics programming. 

**Vectors**

Vectors are simply directions and nothing more. A vector has a direction and a magnitude (AKA length). You can think of vectors like a point on a map. Vectors have can work with 2 to 4 dimensions. If a vector has 2 dimensions it represents a direction on an (X,Y) plane and if a vector has 3 dimensions (X,Y,Z), it can represent any direction in a 3D world. 

Below there are 3 vectors where each vector is in 2D (X,Y) as arrows on a graph. Because it is more intuitive to display vectors in 2D rather than 3D you can think of the vectors as 3D but with a z coordinate of 0. Since vector represent directions, the origin of the vector does not change its value. In the graph below we can see that the vectors v and w are equal even though their origin is different.

When describing vectors people generally prefer to describe vectors as characters with a line over them. But since I have issues with that using a regular text editor like obsidian I am just going to describe them using a basic character like this for example: v = (X,Y,Z).
