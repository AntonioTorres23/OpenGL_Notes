Brightness and color values, by default, are clamped between $0.0$ and $1.0$ when stored into a framebuffer. This, at first seemingly innocent, statement caused us to always specify light and color values somewhere in this range, trying to make them fit into the scene. This works ok and gives decent results, but what happens if we walk in a really bright area with multiple bright light sources that as a total sum exceed 1.0? The answer is that all fragments that have a brightness or color sum over $1.0$ gets clamped to $1.0$, which isn't pretty to look at.

Due to a large number of fragments' color value getting clamped to 1.0, each of the bright fragments have the same
