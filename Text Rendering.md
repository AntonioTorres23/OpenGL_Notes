At some stage of your graphics adventures you'll want to draw text in OpenGL. Contrary to what you may expect, getting a simple string to render on screen is all but easy with a low-level API like OpenGL. If you don't care about rendering more than 128 different same-sized, then it's probably not too difficult. Things are getting difficult as soon as each character has a different width, height, and margin. Based on where you live, you may also need more than 128 characters, and what if you want to express special symbols for like mathematical expressions or sheet music symbols, and what about rendering text from top to bottom? Once you think about all these complicated matters of text, it wouldn't surprise you that this probably doesn't belong in a low-level API like OpenGL. 

Since there is no support for text capabilities within OpenGL, it is up to us to define a system for rendering text to the screen. There are no graphical primitives for text characters, we have to get creative. Some example techniques are: drawing letter shapes via `GL_LINES`, create 3D meshes of letter, or render character textures to 2D quads in a 3D environment. 

Most developers choose to render charact textures onto quads.
