At some stage of your graphics adventures you'll want to draw text in OpenGL. Contrary to what you may expect, getting a simple string to render on screen is all but easy with a low-level API like OpenGL. If you don't care about rendering more than 128 different same-sized, then it's probably not too difficult. Things are getting difficult as soon as each character has a different width, height, and margin. Based on where you live, you may also need more than 128 characters, and what if you want to express special symbols for like mathematical expressions or sheet music symbols, and what about rendering text from top to bottom? Once you think about all these complicated matters of text, it wouldn't surprise you that this probably doesn't belong in a low-level API like OpenGL. 

Since there is no support for text capabilities within OpenGL, it is up to us to define a system for rendering text to the screen. There are no graphical primitives for text characters, we have to get creative. Some example techniques are: drawing letter shapes via `GL_LINES`, create 3D meshes of letter, or render character textures to 2D quads in a 3D environment. 

Most developers choose to render charact textures onto quads. Rendering textured quads by itself shouldn't be too difficult, but getting the relevant character(s) onto a texture could prove challenging. In these notes we'll explore several methods and implement a more advanced, but flexible technique for rendering text using the FreeType library. 

**Classical Text Rendering: Bitmap Fonts**

In the early days, rendering text involved selecting a font (or creating one yourself) you'd like for your application and extracting all relevant characters out of this font to place them within a single large texture. Such a texture, that we call a **bitmap font**, contains all character symbols we want to use in predefined regions of the texture. These character symbols of the font are known as **glyphs**. Each glyph has a specific region of texture coordinates associated with them. Whenever you want to render a character, you  select the corresponding glyph by rending this section of the bitmap font to a 2D quad.

Here you can see how we would render the text `OpenGL` by taking a bitmap font and sampling the corresponding glyphs from the texture (carefully choosing the texture coordinates) that we render on top of several quads. By enabling [blending](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Blending) and keeping the background transparent, we will end up with just a string of characters to the screen. This particular bitmap font was generated using Codehead's Bitmap [Font Generator](http://www.codehead.co.uk/cbfg/).

This approach has several advantages and disadvantages. It is relatively easy to implement and because bitmap fonts are pre-rasterized, they're quite efficient. However, it is not particularly flexible. When you want to use a different font, you need to recompile a complete new bitmap font and the system is limited to a single resolution;
