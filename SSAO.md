We've briefly touched the topic in the basic lighting notes: ambient lighting. Ambient lighting is a fixed light constant we add to the overall lighting of a scene to simulate the scattering of light. In reality, light scatters in all kinds of directions with varying intensities so the indirectly lit parts of a scene should also have varying intensities. One type of lighting approximation is called **ambient occlusion** that tries to approximate indirect lighting by darkening creases, holes, and surfaces that are close to each other. These areas are largely occluded by surrounding geometry and thus light rays have fewer places to escape to, hence the areas appear darker. Take a look at the corners and creases of your room to see that the light there seems just a little darker. 

Below is an example image of a scene with and without ambient occlusion. Notice how especially between the creases, the (ambient) light is more occluded.
