The way we did lighting so far was called **forward rendering** or **forward shading**. A straightforward approach where we render an object and light it according to all the light sources in a scene. We do this for every object individually for the object in the scene. While quite easy to understand and implement it is also quite heavy on performance as each rendered object has to iterate over each light source for every rendered fragment, which is a lot! Forward rendering also tends to waste a lot of fragment shader runs in scenes with a high depth complexity (multiple objects cover the same screen pixel) as fragment shader outputs are overwritten. 

**Deferred Shading** or **deferred rendering** aims to overcomes these issues by drastically changing the way we render objects. This gives us several new options to significantly optimize scenes with large numbers of lights. The following image is a scene with 1847 point lights rendered with deferred shading (image courtesy of Hannes Nevalainen); something that wouldn't be possible with forward rendering.
