Between the vertex and the fragment shader there is an optional shader stage called the geometry shader. A geometry shader takes as input a set of vertices that form a single primitive e.g. a point or a triangle. The geometry shader can then transform these vertices as it sees fit before sending them to the next shader stage. What makes the geometry shader interesting is that it is able to convert the original primitive (set of vertices) to completely different primitives, possibly generating more vertices than were initially given. 

We're going to throw you right into the deep by showing you an example of a geometry shader.

```
#version 330 core
layout (points) in;
layout (line_strip, max_vertices = 2) out;

void main()
{
	gl_Position = gl_in[0].gl_Position + vec4(-0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
}
```
