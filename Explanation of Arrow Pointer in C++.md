The arrow pointer is a weird and unusual thing within C++ that over the past year has left me often confused. 

This symbol `->` refers to when you have a pointer that is pointing to an object and you want to access data from within that object. Whether it be a variable within the class or something else. 

From what I remember it's a way to simplify the usual `*` that is used to access a value that is stored within the pointer. Because if you wanted to get the value of something within a pointer object, combining that with a dot can be confusing and you have to use a specific syntax. So using the `->` is easier and is why it was developed. 


Take this source code as an example.
