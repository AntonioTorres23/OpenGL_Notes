In the shadow mapping notes we learned to create dynamic shadows with shadow mapping. It works great, but it's mostly suited for directional (or spot) lights as the shadows are generated only in the direction of the light source. It is therefore also known as **directional shadow mapping** as the depth (or shadow) map is generated from only the direction the light is looking at.
