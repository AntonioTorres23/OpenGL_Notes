Shadows are a result of the absence of light due to occlusion. When a light source's rays do not hit an object because it gets occluded by some other object, the object is in shadow. Shadows add a great deal of realism to a lit scene and make it easier for a viewer to observe spatial relationships between objects. They give a greater sense of depth to your scene and objects. For example, take a look at the following image of a scene with and without shadows.

You can see that with shadows it becomes much more obvious how objects relate to each other. For instance, the fact that one of the cubes is floating above the others is only really noticeable when we have shadows. 

Shadows are a bit tricky to implement though, specifically because in current real-time (rasterized graphics) research a perfect shadow algorithm hasn't been developed yet. There are several good shadow
